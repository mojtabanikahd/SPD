## üß™ Experiments Overview

### üî¨ Synthetic Experiments
- **First Scenario:** Compares SPD-trace with APGD D-trace and CrossFDTL on runtime and accuracy.
- **Second Scenario:** Evaluates robustness of SPD-trace using heterogeneous vs. homogeneous datasets.
- Metrics: Precision, recall, and computation time.

### üß¨ Real-World Application: Ovarian Cancer (TCGA)
- Inference of differential networks between platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumors.
- Model selection via StARS.
- Biological validation via enrichment tests using known gene sets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

### üì¶ Required Software
- **R** (>= 4.0.0)
- **C++ compiler** (with Rcpp support)

### üì¶ Required R Packages

Install the necessary packages using the following in R:

```r
install.packages(c("Rcpp", "igraph", "Matrix"))
# You may also need 'DiffGraph' for reference:
# install.packages("DiffGraph")
```

> Note: `editedDTrace.R` is a modified version of the D-trace method from the `DiffGraph` package.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Clone the repository and launch R or use terminal commands as shown below.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Synthetic Experiments

**First Scenario: Performance Comparison**
```bash
Rscript Simulation/First_Scenario.R
```

**Second Scenario: Heterogeneous Datasets**
```bash
Rscript Simulation/Second_Scenario.R
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Real Data Experiment (Ovarian Cancer)

```bash
Rscript Overian_cancer/Ovarian.R
```

The output including the inferred differential network will be saved to `Overian_cancer/Results/`.
